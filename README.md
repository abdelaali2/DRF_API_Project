## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Key Features :

1. User Authentication using Tokens: Users can authenticate using token-based authentication. Tokens are generated upon successful login and are required for accessing protected endpoints. Tokens expire after an hour, ensuring security.
2. Category Management System: The API allows the management of categories through API endpoints provided by DRF. Categories can be created, retrieved, updated, and deleted using the API.
3. Product Catalog with Search and Filter Functionality: Users can browse products by categories and search for specific products using keywords. The API provides endpoints for retrieving products by category and searching for products based on keywords. Products can be filtered based on various criteria such as price, ratings, etc.
4. User Management System: Users can create an account, update their profile, and view their order history through the API endpoints. User accounts are protected with token-based authentication, ensuring secure access to user information.
5. Checkout Functionality: The API allows users to complete the checkout process by collecting user information, shipping details, and payment information. Checkout functionality is implemented through API endpoints that handle order creation, order retrieval, and payment processing.
